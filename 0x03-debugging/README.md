# Description for each program

1. 0-main.c, main.h
   * The program will create 0-main.c and main.h to test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
2. 1-main.c
   * Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
