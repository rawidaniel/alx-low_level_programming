# Description for each script

1. 0-positive_or_negative.c
   * The C program code will print whether the number stored in variable n is positive or zero or negative.
2. 1-last_digit.c
   * This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The output of the program will be the string is, followed by if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5, if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 and if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0.
3. 2-print_alphabet.c
   * A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Using only putchar function twice.
4. 3-print_alphabets.
   * A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. Using putchar function.
