# Description for each script

1. 0-positive_or_negative.c
   * The C program code will print whether the number stored in variable n is positive or zero or negative.
2. 1-last_digit.c
   * This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The output of the program will be the string is, followed by if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5, if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 and if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0.
3. 2-print_alphabet.c
   * A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Using only putchar function twice.
4. 3-print_alphabets.
   * A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. Using putchar function.
5. 4-print_alphabt.c
   * A

6. 5-print_numbers.c
   * A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. 6-print_numberz.c
   * A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. using putchar function only twice.
8. 7-print_tebahpla.c
   * A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. Using putchar function.
9. 9-print_comb.c
   * A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space.using only putchar function and only use four times maximum in your code.
10. 100-print_comb3.c
    * A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.Numbers will be separated by ,, followed by a space. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. only it uses putchar function to print the output.
11. 101-print_comb4.c 
    * A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.Numbers will be separated by ,, followed by a space.012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0,1 and 2. only it uses putchar function to print the output.
12. 102-print_comb5.c
    * A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
