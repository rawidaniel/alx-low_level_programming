# Description for function

1. 0-strcat.c
   * A function that concatenates two strings where this function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte and return string dest.
2. 1-strncat.c
   * A function that concatenates two strings where the _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.finally it returns string dest.
3. 2-strncpy.c
   * A function that copies n bytes of character from source string to destination string.
4. 3-strcmp.c
   * A function that compares two strings.
5. 4-rev_array.c
   * A function that reverses the content of an array of integers where n is the number of elements of the array.
6. 5-string_toupper.c
   * A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. 6-cap_string.c
   * A function that capitalizes all words of a string where separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }.
8. 7-leet.c
   * A function that encodes a string into 1337 where letters a and A should be replaced by 4, e and E should be replaced by 3, o and O should be replaced by 0, t and T should be replaced by 7 and l and L should be replaced by 1. You can only use one if and two loop in your code. You are not allowed to use switch and any ternary operation.
9. 100-rot13.c
   * A function that encodes a string using rot13 where you can only use one if and two loop in your code. You are not allowed to use switch and any ternary operation.
10. 101-print_number.c
    * function that prints an integer.You can only use _putchar function to print.You are not allowed to use long, arrays or pointers and hard-code special values.
11. 102-magic.c
    * A program that prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
12. 103-infinite_add.
    * A function that adds two numbers.
13. 104-print_buffer.c
    * A function that prints a buffer. - must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b - output should print 10 bytes per line - each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0 - each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space - each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print . - each line ends with a new line \n - if size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n.
