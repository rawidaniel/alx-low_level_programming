# Description for function

1. 0-strcat.c
   * A function that concatenates two strings where this function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte and return string dest.
2. 1-strncat.c
   * A function that concatenates two strings where the _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.finally it returns string dest.
